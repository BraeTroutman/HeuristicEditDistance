# Edist

Julia implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch pairwise sequence alignment algorithm, along with
the Hirschberg space-efficient divide-and-conquer version of the algorithm and a heuristic
implementation that approximates the score for the alignment of two sequences.

## Source Structure

The project can be loaded into the Julia environment by running

```
julia --project=.
```

inside the project root directory. The source code can be exposed and precompiled in the global namespace with `using Edist`

The project has 3 modules, `Full`, `Hirschberg`, and `Bounded` corresponding to the full dynamic programming implementation,
Hirschberg divide and conquer, and spatially bounded heuristic. For the most part these internal implementations can be ignored
aside from specific parameter tuning.

The main functionality is exposed through the `align` and `score` functions, which serve as a wrapper around the various submodules
to expose alignment and scoring in an implementation-agnostic way. Both take a module name as the first argument, as well as two strings,
and returns the alignment/score generated by the implementation specified in the module name, e.g.

```julia-repl
julia> align(Bounded, "CACTAG", "ATCA")
(score = -4, seq_alignment = "CACTAG", query_alignment = "-A-TCA", memory_used = 376)
```

`score` functions similarly but only returns the score
